- **Family members** navigating disagreements
- **Roommates** resolving household conflicts
- **Coworkers** improving professional communication

5. **Provides a safe space** for difficult conversations

### Why NVC Works

- **Removes blame**: Focus on needs, not accusations
- **Builds empathy**: Understanding before solving
- **Creates clarity**: Specific observations and requests
- **Maintains respect**: Both parties' needs matter equally

### How to Respond

---

## Session Stages Explained

The AI guides you through eight stages:

### Stage 1: Intake
**Purpose**: Understand the basic situation

The AI will ask:
- What's the topic you want to address?
- Who's involved?
- What prompted you to start this session?

### Stage 2: Observation
**Purpose**: Identify specific facts (not judgments)

The AI helps you:
- Separate facts from interpretations
- Describe what actually happened
- Avoid generalizations ("always", "never")

**Example transformation:**
- Before: "You never listen to me"
- After: "In our conversation yesterday, when I was talking about my day, you were looking at your phone"

### Stage 3: Feeling
**Purpose**: Identify your emotions

The AI helps you:
- Name specific feelings (angry, sad, frustrated, anxious)
- Distinguish feelings from thoughts
- Connect feelings to the situation

**Feelings vocabulary:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Sad | disappointed, discouraged, lonely, hurt |
| Angry | frustrated, irritated, resentful, annoyed |
| Scared | anxious, worried, nervous, insecure |
| Confused | puzzled, uncertain, lost, torn |
| Happy | grateful, relieved, hopeful, content |

### Stage 4: Need
**Purpose**: Identify underlying needs

The AI helps you:
- Discover what you truly need (beneath the surface)
- Express needs without blaming
- Recognize universal human needs

**Common needs:**
- Connection (understanding, acceptance, belonging)
- Autonomy (freedom, choice, independence)
- Security (safety, stability, trust)
- Meaning (purpose, contribution, growth)
- Physical (rest, sustenance, comfort)

### Stage 5: Request
**Purpose**: Form specific, actionable requests

The AI helps you:
- Make requests (not demands)
- Be specific and positive
- Check if requests are realistic

**Good requests:**
- "Would you be willing to put your phone away during dinner?"
- "Can we set a weekly time to discuss finances together?"
- "I'd like us to check in with each other before making purchases over $100"

### Stage 6: Reflection
**Purpose**: Review and validate what you've discovered

The AI summarizes:
- Your observation
- Your feelings
- Your underlying needs
- Your requests

### Stage 7: Common Ground (For Partner Sessions)
**Purpose**: Find shared understanding

The AI helps:
- Identify areas of agreement
- Acknowledge each other's perspectives
- Build mutual understanding

### Stage 8: Agreement
**Purpose**: Create concrete action items

You'll create:
- Specific commitments from each party
- Timeline for implementation
- Plan for follow-up

## Tips for Effective Sessions

2. **Be open**: Enter with willingness to understand
3. **Set aside time**: Give yourself at least 15-20 minutes
4. **Find privacy**: Use the app where you can reflect honestly

### During the Session

1. **Be honest**: The AI keeps everything confidential
2. **Take your time**: Pause if you need to think
3. **Stay curious**: Ask yourself "What do I really need?"
4. **Trust the process**: Each stage builds on the previous

### Communication Tips

**Do:**
- Use "I" statements ("I feel..." "I need...")
- Give specific examples
- Stay focused on one topic at a time
- Acknowledge your own contribution to the conflict

**Don't:**
- Use "always" or "never"
- Blame or attack the other person
- Bring up past grievances
- Try to "win" the argument

### After the Session

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my conversation with the AI private?**
A: Yes. Your sessions are stored securely and only accessible to you and any partners you've invited to that specific session.

**Q: Can I use this instead of therapy?**
A: Talk-It-Out-AI is a helpful tool, but it's not a replacement for professional therapy. Consider it a supplement to, not a substitute for, professional help when needed.

**Q: How long does a typical session take?**
A: Most sessions take 15-30 minutes, but you can pause and return anytime. Complex topics may require multiple sessions.

**Q: Can I delete my sessions?**
A: Contact your administrator about data management options.

### Using the App

**Q: What if I don't know how I feel?**
A: That's normal! The AI will help you explore your feelings with questions and examples. Take your time.

**Q: Can I skip stages?**
A: The stages build on each other, so skipping isn't recommended. However, you can ask the AI to move forward if you feel ready.

**Q: What if I disagree with the AI's suggestions?**
A: The AI is a guide, not an authority. Express your disagreement and the AI will adapt. You're always in control.

**Q: Can I have multiple sessions about the same topic?**
A: Absolutely! Many conflicts require multiple conversations. Start new sessions as needed.

### Partner Sessions

**Q: Does my partner see everything I type?**
A: Only in shared sessions. Your personal sessions remain private unless you specifically invite them.

**Q: What if my partner won't participate?**
A: You can still benefit from solo sessions. Working on your own communication skills helps regardless.

**Q: Can I remove a partner?**
A: Yes, go to the Partners page and select "End Partnership" (this doesn't affect existing sessions).
