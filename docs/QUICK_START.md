### Use Case 1: Self-Reflection (Solo) ⭐ Start Here

**Goal**: Learn the basic flow with a low-pressure topic

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Topic to Enter**: "I want to understand why I get frustrated during meetings"

**What You'll Learn**:
- How the AI guides you through questions
- The difference between observations and judgments
- How to identify your feelings

**Try This**:
1. Start a new session with the topic above
2. When asked what happened, describe a specific meeting
3. Notice how the AI helps you separate facts from interpretations
4. Identify at least 2 feelings you experienced

**Example Dialogue**:

```
AI: Welcome! I'm here to help you explore this topic. Can you tell me
    about a specific meeting where you felt frustrated?

You: Last Tuesday's team meeting. My manager interrupted me three times
     while I was presenting my idea.

AI: Thank you for sharing that specific example. You mentioned your
    manager interrupted you three times during your presentation.
    How did that feel in the moment?

You: I felt dismissed and unimportant. Like my ideas didn't matter.

AI: I hear that you felt dismissed and unimportant. Those are significant
    feelings. When you felt that way, what do you think you were needing
    in that situation?
```

**Success Criteria**: Complete the feeling stage and identify at least one underlying need.

---

### Use Case 2: The "Always/Never" Trap (Solo)

**Goal**: Practice turning generalizations into specific observations

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Topic to Enter**: "Someone in my life doesn't listen to me"

**What You'll Learn**:
- Why "always" and "never" are unhelpful
- How to describe specific incidents
- The power of concrete examples

**Try This**:
1. Start with a general complaint (the AI will help you get specific)
2. When you catch yourself using "always" or "never," stop and revise
3. Give one specific example instead

**Before and After Examples**:

| Generalization | Specific Observation |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "They never listen" | "During dinner yesterday, I mentioned my work problem and they picked up their phone" |
| "They always criticize" | "When I showed them my report last week, they pointed out three errors before saying anything positive" |
| "They don't care" | "I asked for help with the dishes twice this week and both times they said they would but didn't" |

**Success Criteria**: Transform at least one generalization into a specific observation.

---

### Use Case 3: Feelings vs. Thoughts (Solo)

**Goal**: Distinguish between real feelings and thoughts disguised as feelings

"I feel that I'm being ignored"
"I feel unappreciated"

ACTUAL FEELING:
"I feel hurt"
"I feel lonely"
"I feel sad and discouraged"
```

**Try This**:
1. Start the session and share a situation
