# Acknowledgments

This project was built entirely with AI assistance, demonstrating the power of modern AI-driven development workflows.

## AI Development Tools

### Claude Code & Claude Opus 4.5

**All code and documentation in this project were generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) powered by Claude Opus 4.5.**

Claude Code served as the primary development assistant, handling:
- Full-stack application architecture and implementation
- React components and Next.js pages
- API route development
- Database schema design with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication system with NextAuth.js
- AI integration with Anthropic Claude API
- Comprehensive documentation (README, guides, tutorials)
- Bug fixes and iterative improvements
- Git commit management

### Claude in Chrome

**[Claude in Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-in-chrome/)** played a powerful role in:

- **Automated Neon Database Setup**: With minimal manual intervention (only username and password provided), Claude in Chrome navigated the Neon dashboard, created the database project, and configured the connection—eliminating the need for manual database provisioning steps.

- **UI/UX Debugging**: Claude in Chrome's browser automation capabilities enabled automatic detection and fixing of UI issues by:
  - Taking screenshots to identify visual problems
  - Navigating the application to test user flows
  - Identifying CSS and layout issues
  - Verifying fixes in real-time through the browser

This combination of Claude Code (for code generation) and Claude in Chrome (for browser automation) created an efficient development workflow with minimal manual intervention.

## Development Methodology

### BMAD Method

The **[BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-method/BMAD-METHOD)** (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) was used to create the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this project.

BMAD provides a structured approach to AI-assisted software development through:
- Specialized AI agents for different roles (Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer)
- Four-phase workflow (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation)
- Story-driven development with continuous alignment
- Document sharding for efficient context management

The PRD generated through BMAD defined:
- User personas and stories
- Feature specifications
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Epic breakdown and prioritization

See [docs/relationship_debugger_PRD.md](docs/relationship_debugger_PRD.md) for the complete PRD.

### Superpowers Plugin Skills

The **[Superpowers Plugin](https://github.com/superpowers-ai/superpowers)** for Claude Code was extensively used during the planning and development phases. The following skills were employed:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/superpowers:brainstorming` | Initial ideation and requirements exploration. Used to turn the initial concept into a fully-formed design through collaborative dialogue. |
| `/superpowers:writing-plans` | Creating detailed implementation plans with bite-sized tasks. Ensured comprehensive planning with exact file paths, code snippets, and testing steps. |
| `/superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Executing plans with fresh subagents per task. Enabled two-stage reviews (spec compliance + code quality) after each implementation task. |

These skills provided:
- Structured approach to brainstorming and design
- Comprehensive implementation plans with TDD focus
- Quality gates through automated code reviews
- Efficient context management with fresh subagents

## Frameworks & Methodology Credits

### Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

The therapeutic framework underlying this application is **Nonviolent Communication**, developed by **Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D.**

NVC is a communication process that helps people:
- Connect with themselves and others more compassionately
- Express feelings and needs without blame or judgment
- Make requests rather than demands
- Resolve conflicts through mutual understanding
